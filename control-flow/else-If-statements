#Calvin Coolidgeâ€™s Cool College has noticed that students prefer to get letter grades.
#Write an if/elif/else statement that:
#If grade is 90 or higher, print "A"
#Else if grade is 80 or higher, print "B"
#Else if grade is 70 or higher, print "C"
#Else if grade is 60 or higher, print "D"
#Else, print "F"


grade = 86

if grade >= 90:
  print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
  print("B")
elif grade >= 70:
  print("C")
elif grade >= 60:
  print ("D")
else: 
  print("F")
