#The registrar’s office at Calvin Coolidge’s Cool College has another request. They want to send out a mailer with information on the commencement ceremonies to students who have met at least one requirement for graduation (120 credits and 2.0 GPA). 
#Write an if statement that checks if a student either has 120 or more credits or a GPA 2.0 or higher, and if so prints: "You have met at least one of the requirements."

credits = 118
gpa = 2.0

if credits >= 120 or gpa >= 2.0:
