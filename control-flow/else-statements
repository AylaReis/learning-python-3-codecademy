#Calvin Coolidgeâ€™s Cool College has another request for you. They want you to add an additional check to a previous if statement. If a student is failing to meet both graduation requirements, they want it to print:
#"You do not meet the requirements to graduate."
#Add an else statement to the existing if statement.

credits = 120
gpa = 1.9

if (credits >= 120) and (gpa >= 2.0):
  print("You meet the requirements to graduate!")
else:
  print("You do not meet the requirements to graduate.")
