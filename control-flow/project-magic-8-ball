#In magic8.py, declare a variable name and assign it to the name of the person who will be asking the Magic 8-Ball.
name = "Jay"


#Next, declare a variable question, and assign to a “Yes” or “No” question you’d like to ask the Magic 8-Ball.

question = "Am I a good person?"


#We want to store the answer of the Magic 8-Ball in another variable, which we’ll call answer. For now, assign this variable to an empty string.

answer = ""


# In order for the answer to be different each time we run the program, we will utilize randomly generated values. 
#In Python, we can use the .randint() function from the random module to generate a random number from a range.
#But first, let’s import this module so we can use its functions. Add this line of code to the top of magic8.py:

import random


#Next, we’ll create a variable to store the randomly generated value. Declare a variable called random_number, and assign it to the function call:
#random.randint(1, 9)
#which will generate a random number between 1 (inclusive) and 9 (inclusive).
#Next, add a print() statement that outputs the value of random_number, and run the program several times to ensure random values are being generated as expected.
# Once you’re sure this is working as we expected, feel free to comment out this print() statement.

random_number = random.randint (1, 9)
print(random_number) # gera números aleatórios

# Now that we’ve declared all the variables needed, it’s time to implement the core logic of our program!
#For this section, we’ll be utilizing control flow using an if/elif/else statement to assign different answers for each randomly generated value.
#First, write an if statement where if the random_number is equal to 1, answer is assigned to the phrase “Yes - definitely.”
#Next, write an elif statement after the if statement where if the random_number is equal to 2, answer is assigned to the phrase “It is decidedly so”.
#Then, continue writing elif statements for each of the remaining phrases for the values 3 to 9.
#Recall that the 9 possible answers of the Magic 8-Ball are:
#Yes - definitely.
#It is decidedly so.
#Without a doubt.
#Reply hazy, try again.
#Ask again later.
#Better not tell you now.
#My sources say no.
#Outlook not so good.
#Very doubtful.
#Following the if/elif statements, add an else statement that will set answer to the string “Error”, if the number was accidentally assigned a value outside of our range.

if random_number == 1:
 answer = "Yes - definitely."
elif random_number == 2: 
  answer = "It is decidedly so."
elif random_number == 3:
  answer = "Without a doubt."
elif random_number == 4:
  answer = "Reply hazy, try again"
elif random_number == 5:
  answer = "Ask again later.."
elif random_number == 6:
  answer = "Better not tell you now."
elif random_number == 7:
  answer = "My sources say no."
elif random_number == 8:
  answer = "Outlook not so good."
elif random_number == 9:
  answer = "Very doubtful."
else:
   answer = "Error"


#Now, let’s see our program in action! Write a print() statement to output the asker’s name and their question, which should be in the following format:
# [Name] asks: [Question]

print(name + " asks: " + question)


# Add a second print() statement that will output the Magic 8-Ball’s answer in the following format:
# Magic 8-Ball's answer: [answer]

print("Magic 8-Ball's answer: " + answer )
