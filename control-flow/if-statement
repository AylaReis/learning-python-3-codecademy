#In script.py, there is an if statement. I wrote this because my coworker Dave kept using my computer without permission and he is a real doofus. If the user_name is Dave, it tells him to stay off my computer.
#Enter a user name in the field for user_name and try running the program.

user_name =  "Dave"
if user_name = "Dave":
  print("Get off my computer Dave!")
  
#Oh no! We got a SyntaxError! This happens when we make a small error in the syntax of the conditional statement.
#Read through the error message carefully and see if you can find the error. Then, fix it, and run the code again.
user_name =  "Dave"
if user_name == "Dave":
  print("Get off my computer Dave!")
  
#Ugh! Dave got around my security and has been logging onto my computer using our coworker Angela’s user name, angela_catlady_87. 
#Set your user_name to be angela_catlady_87. Update the program with a second if statement so it checks for Angela’s user name as well and prints: 
#"I know it is you, Dave! Go away!"
#in response. That’ll teach him!
