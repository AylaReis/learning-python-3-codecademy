#Little Codey is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.
#Write a space.py program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:
#Checks which number planet is equal to.
#It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.
#Here is the table of conversion:
#	Planet	Relative Gravity
#1	Venus	0.91
#2	Mars	0.38
#3	Jupiter	2.34
#4	Saturn	1.06
#5	Uranus	0.92
#6	Neptune	1.19
