#We have defined a list heights of visitors to a theme park. In order to ride the Topsy Turvy Tumbletron roller coaster, you need to be above 161 centimeters.
#Using a list comprehension, create a new list called can_ride_coaster that has every element from heights that is greater than 161.
heights = [161, 164, 156, 144, 158, 170, 163, 163, 157]

can_ride_coaster = [num for num in heights if num >161]

#Print can_ride_coaster.

print(can_ride_coaster)
