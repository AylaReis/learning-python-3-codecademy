#Carly wants to be able to market her low prices. We want to find out what the average price of a cut is.
First, let’s sum up all the prices of haircuts. Create a variable total_price, and set it to 0.
hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]
prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]
last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]

total_price = 0

#Loop through the prices list and add each price to the variable total_price.

for price in prices:
  total_price = total_price + price

#After your loop, create a variable called average_price that is the total_price divided by the number of prices.
#You can get the number of prices by using the len() function.

average_price = total_price / len(prices)

#Print the value of average_price 

print("Avarage Haircut Prices: ", average_price)

#That average price is more expensive than Carly thought it would be! She wants to cut all prices by 5 dollars.
#Use a list comprehension to make a list called new_prices, which has each element in prices minus 5.

new_prices = []

for price in prices:
  new_prices.append(price - 5)

#Print new_prices.

print(new_prices)

#Carly really wants to make sure that Carly’s Clippers is a profitable endeavor. She first wants to know how much revenue was brought in last week.
#Create a variable called total_revenue and set it to 0.

total_revenue = 0

#Use a for loop to create a variable i that goes from 0 to len(hairstyles)
#Hint: You can use range() to do this!

for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  
#Add the product of prices[i] (the price of the haircut at position i) and last_week[i] (the number of people who got the haircut at position i) to total_revenue at each step.
  
  total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week [i]

#After your loop, print the value of total_revenue

print("Total Revenue: ", total_revenue)

#Find the average daily revenue by dividing total_revenue by "8". Call this number average_daily_revenue and print it out.

average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 8
print(average_daily_revenue)

#Carly thinks she can bring in more customers by advertising all of the haircuts she has that are under 30 dollars.
#Use a list comprehension to create a list called cuts_under_30 that has the entry hairstyles[i] for each i for which new_prices[i] is less than 30.
#You can use range() in your list comprehension to make i go from 0 to len(new_prices) - 1.

cuts_under_30 = [hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(hairstyles)) if new_prices[i] < 30 ]

#Print cuts_under_30.

print(cuts_under_30)
