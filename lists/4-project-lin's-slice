#To keep track of the kinds of pizzas you sell, create a list called toppings that holds the following:
#"pepperoni", "pineapple","cheese","sausage","olives","anchovies", "mushrooms"

toppings = ["pepperoni", "pineapple", "cheese", "sausage", "olives", "anchovies", "mushrooms"]

#To keep track of how much each kind of pizza slice costs, create a list called prices that holds the following integer values:
#2, 6,1,3,2,7,2

prices =[2, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 2]

#Your boss wants you to do some research on $2 slices.
#Count the number of occurrences of 2 in the prices list, and store the result in a variable called num_two_dollar_slices. Print it out.

num_two_dollar_slices = prices.count(2)
print(num_two_dollar_slices)

#Find the length of the toppings list and store it in a variable called num_pizzas.

#Print the string We sell [num_pizzas] different kinds of pizza!, where [num_pizzas] represents the value of our variable num_pizzas.

#Each sublist in pizza_and_prices should have one pizza topping and an associated price.

#6	"pineapple"
#1	"cheese"
#3	"sausage"
#2	"olives"
#7	"anchovies"
#2	"mushrooms"
#For this new list make sure the prices come before the topping name
