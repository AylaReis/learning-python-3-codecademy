#We want to have a way to store all of our classroom test score data.
#Using the provided table, create a two-dimensional list called class_name_test to represent the data. Each sublist in class_name_test should have one student’s name and their associated score.
#Name -	Test Score
#"Jenny"	- 90
#"Alexus"	- 85.5
#"Sam" -	83
#"Ellie" -	101.5
#Print class_name_test to see the result.

class_name_test = [["Jenny", 90], ["Alexus", 85.5], ["Sam", 83], ["Ellie", 101.5]]
print(class_name_test)

#Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Sam‘s test score from the list class_name_test.
#Save it to the variable sams_score.
#Print the variable sams_score to see the result.

sams_score = class_name_test[2][1]
print(sams_score)

#Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Sam‘s test score from the list class_name_test.
#Save it to the variable sams_score.
#Print the variable sams_score to see the result.

ellies_score = class_name_test[-1][-1]
