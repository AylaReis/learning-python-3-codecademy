#Our school is expanding! We are welcoming a new set of students today from all over the world.
#Using the provided table, create a two-dimensional list called incoming_class to represent the data. Each sublist in incoming_class should contain the name, nationality, and grade for a single student.
#Name -	Nationality	Grade Level
#"Kenny" -	"American"	9
#"Tanya"	- "Russian"	9
#"Madison" -	"Indian"	7
#Print incoming_class to see our list.
#Your code below:
incoming_class = [
  ["Kenny", "American", 9],
  ["Tanya", "Russian", 9],
  ["Madison", "Indian", 7]
]
print(incoming_class)

#"Madison" passed an exam to advance a grade. She will be pushed into 8th grade rather than her current 7th in our list.
#Modify the list using double brackets [][] to make the change. Use positive inidices.
#Print incoming_class to see our change.

incoming_class[2][2] = 8
print(incoming_class)

#"Kenny" likes to be called by his nickname "Ken". Modify the list using double brackets [][] to accommodate the change but only using negative indices.
#Print incoming_class to see our change.

incoming_class [-3][-3] = "Ken"
print(incoming_class)
