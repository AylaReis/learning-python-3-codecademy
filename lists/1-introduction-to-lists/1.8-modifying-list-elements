#We have decided to start selling some of our garden produce. Word around our town has spread and people are interested in getting some of our delicious vegetables and fruit.
#We decided to create a waitlist to make sure we can sell to all of our new customers!
#Define a list called garden_waitlist and set the value to contain our customers (in order): "Jiho", "Adam", "Sonny", and "Alisha".

garden_waitlist = ["jiho", "Adam", "Sonny", "Alisha"] 


#"Adam" decided his fridge is too full at the moment and asked us to remove him from the waitlist and make space for one of our other townsfolk.
#Replace "Adam" with our other interested customer "Calla" using the index method we used in the narrative.
#Print garden_waitlist to see the change!
garden_waitlist[1] = "Calla"
print(garden_waitlist)

#Alisha realized she was already stocked with all the items we are selling. She asked us to replace her with her friend Alex who just ran out.
#Replace Alisha with Alex using a negative index.
#Print garden_waitlist again to see the change!

garden_waitlist[-1] = "Alex"
print(garden_waitlist)
