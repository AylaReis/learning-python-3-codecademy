#We have decided to pursue the study of data science in addition to our computer science coursework. We signed up for an online school that would help us become proficient.
#Check out the current list of topics we will be studying in our code editor.
#Click Run to print out the list.
#data_science_topics = ["Machine Learning", "SQL", "Pandas", "Algorithms", "Statistics", "Python 3"]
#print(data_science_topics)

#It looks like we have an overlap with our computer science curriculum for the topic of "Python 3".
#Let’s remove the topic from the list of data_science_topics using our newly learned .pop() method.
#Print data_science_topics to see your result.

data_science_topics.pop()
print(data_science_topics)

#Looks like there is overlap on the "Algorithms" topic as well. Let’s use .pop() to remove it as well.
#Print data_science_topics to see the changes.

data_science_topics.pop(-2)
