#We are helping out a popular grocery store called Jihoâ€™s Produce.
#Every week the store has to choose the order in which it displays some of its popular items on sale in the front window to attract customers.
#Jiho, the store owner, likes to store the items for the display in a list.
#Check out the current display list in our code editor. Click Run to print out the list.
#front_display_list = ["Mango", "Filet Mignon", "Chocolate Milk"]
#print(front_display_list)


#Jiho found out some great news! "Pineapple" is back in stock.
#Jiho would like to put "Pineapple" in the front of the list so it is the first item customers see in the display window.
#Use .insert() to add "Pineapple" to the front of the list.
#Print the resulting list to see the change.

front_display_list.insert(0, "Pineapple")
